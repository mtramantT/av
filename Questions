1. One of my proudest professional achievements was when I graduated my Revature bootcamp.
     We were truly tested not just for our programming skills but for our dedication as well.
     The experience lifted my confidence and helped give me the courage to finally switch my career to a software developer. 

2. I recently recommended the documentation for Styled-components. A React library that turns simple css files into components.
     The documentation is well written and has a lot of useful tips and tricks. I would honestly recommend reading the 
     “Advanced” section of the documentation. It covers theme providers which greatly speeds up styling. 

3. Avality provides services on the computer that help insurance providers communicate with their clientele. 
    The company provides what is called a portal which is kind of like the yellow pages. Providers can easily look up data on 
    clients and visa versa by accessing the portal.
